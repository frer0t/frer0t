### hi !! i'm frérot
welcome to my github profile! i'm passionate about technology, coding, and building cool projects. i enjoy learning new things and experimenting with different tools, that's how i learnt to code.


#### 👷 The latest repos I've pushed to (public)
{{range recentContributions 2}}
- [`{{.Repo.Name}}`]({{.Repo.URL}}) - _"{{.Repo.Description}}"_ **({{humanize .OccurredAt}})**
{{- end}}


🎮 **fun fact**: when i’m not coding, you’ll probably find me 🏃🏽‍♂️ hitting the running trails or 🚴‍♂ cruising around on my bike both are my favorite
ways to unwind. oh, and here’s a quirky thing about me: I care about clean code 🧼, **lowercase vibes** 🔡, and crushing [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/profile/frerot) PBs ⌨️.
