### hi !! i'm frérot
welcome to my github profile! i'm passionate about technology, coding, and building cool projects. i enjoy learning new things and experimenting with different tools, that's how i learnt to code.


#### 👷 The latest repos I've pushed to (public)

- [`markscribe-ts`](https://github.com/frer0t/markscribe-ts) - _"typescript version of markscribe"_ **(1 week ago)**
- [`site`](https://github.com/frer0t/site) - _"this is my digital playground where i show off cool stuff i've made, talk about what i know, and share my professional journey. think of it as my little home on the internet where you can learn all about me and my work!"_ **(1 week ago)**


🎮 **fun fact**: when i’m not coding, you’ll probably find me 🏃🏽‍♂️ hitting the running trails or 🚴‍♂ cruising around on my bike both are my favorite
ways to unwind. oh, and here’s a quirky thing about me: I care about clean code 🧼, **lowercase vibes** 🔡, and crushing [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/profile/frerot) PBs ⌨️.
